Hi! I am Prateek. I first created a repository and now I am trying to understand how GitHub works. For this, I first created a branch and then making an edit in this branch. Thank You. Dated 03/26/2020
This time I am doing it all by myself without referring anywhere :
1). Create a new Branch
2). Click the edit sign in the .md file and make the changes.
3). Add an optional description and click commit.
4). Later delete the new branch that is created in step 1.
